# Introduction

The Give.io REST API utilizes predictable, resource-oriented endpoints, and uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors.

At this time, public registration for Developer Keys is not available.

> The base API is located here:
